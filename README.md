# monkey-don-type

This is a simple python automation script that uses Selenium web scraping on monkeytype.com to scrape the wordlist to type (currently only on TIME session) and can send the characters according to any 
typing speed and can also adjust the time of session.


Insert the location of chromedrive in your device inside `""` in `s=Service("")` .


If you are interested, you can code in the login credentials of your monkeytype account and also adject the chrome session as needed
